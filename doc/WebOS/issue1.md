# WebOS

https://github.com/webosorg/webos/issues/1

This Project looks great for the new thinking world

What technologies I'm going to put in:

-   [[WASM]] as the base of core
-   JS is the base of it, but it looks the hell for me
-   Forth language can be thought as a semantic model for the very first time -- I can't found anithing in IT which is more simple
-   [[Rust]] is the great tooling language for writing the core VM
-   Smalltalk and Python with its OOP model
-   Erlang with its multitasking and supervizor magic

Finally, how can I mix all of them?

What I want:

-   flexible
-   interactive environment
-   can be deeeply described in a book or tutorial
-   easy to accept for people which scares of ''+[] expressions of JS hell
-   can be run in client browser without any or very tiny backend sever part
-   based on async message processing
-   the server on VDS with very cheap pricing, can be required only for the message passing between browser-side VM instances

I feel myself out of general line of the "Therd reigh of JS" . While every time I'm trinng to enter to the JS hell, my brain is boiling about any programming principle I see in it.

What blocks me:

type hell: ''+[] is valid, nothing can explode my brain more then adding string with empty list

Why the hell I can't have a lower level environment for making my experiments in a cross-browser Univercity?!

PS: please, don't drop this issue thread, it can be sustained as an artefact for the next step of the Web

I come from the era of ZX Spectrum then every byte was a significant.  

What is exploding my mind is the tendence of making things in a Web that goes far away from the feel of the Machine.

The concept of the Backend is totally wrong.
Every user which opens some site if fact provides its own computing resources for all users if this site, but the Technology does not provide a transparent way to use it.

Look on a modern mobile phone: you have 4/8 CPU cores with 4+ Gigs of RAM, all of them are available for the Web browser (mostly in a non-direct way).

But: how we can use this power? The whole steam is going into the whistle!

What is going on when I start a browser on my i7-920 workstation? Anything is going to dirt in a few minutes, until the Glorious JavaScript V8 Engine is starting.

what do i get in return? Only illogical world with the npm, CSS and something the same hell-like DOM.

It looks for me as people forget that they are reached in last 50 years.
The JS approach crossed anything was done before.
